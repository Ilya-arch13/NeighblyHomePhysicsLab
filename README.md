## The Philosophy: function ∝ aesthetics

This project was born from a simple observation: our built environment often forces us to choose between efficiency and beauty. I believe this is a false dichotomy. My core philosophy, encapsulated in the formula **function ∝ aesthetics**, is that optimal physical function, when guided by the fundamental laws of nature, creates beauty as an inevitable consequence.

This repository is an attempt to prove this relationship through code, transforming architectural design from a practice of compromise into a science of harmony.

## What is This Project?

**NeighblyHomePhysicsLab** is an open-source computational engine designed to analyze and evaluate architectural spaces. Its ultimate goal is to generate a single, elegant metric: the **Index of Architectural Harmony**.

This index (from 0 to 1) is a calculated average of two core components:

* **The Function Index:** An objective score based on the physical performance of a space. It is calculated using modules that analyze:
    * **Thermodynamics (`thermal.py`):** Heat loss, insulation efficiency, and airflow.
    * **Optics (`optic.py`):** Natural light distribution, shadow analysis, and glare.

* **The Beauty Index:** A quantitative score derived from qualitative, human-centric data. This index will be developed by analyzing:
    * **Social Metrics (`social.py`):** Data from real-world case studies on how people feel, interact, and thrive in different environments. This module is the proposed focus of my research collaboration at Cornell University.

## The Vision

The vision for this project extends beyond this repository. The `NeighblyHomePhysicsLab` engine is designed to be the "brain" behind applications like Neighbly, providing data-driven recommendations for improving our homes and communities.

I entered this journey with an app and a GitHub project. I plan to leave university with buildings powered by this same engine.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a modular structure for clarity and scalability:

* **/core:** Fundamental physics constants and universal functions.
* **/modules:** The main analysis modules for Thermodynamics, Optics, and Social metrics.
* **/data:** Datasets for benchmarks and case studies.
* **/visualizer:** Scripts for generating heatmaps, light simulations, and other visuals.
* **/examples:** Sample scripts showing how to use the engine.

## Contribution

This project is a starting point for a larger conversation about the future of architecture. Ideas, contributions, and collaborations are welcome.
