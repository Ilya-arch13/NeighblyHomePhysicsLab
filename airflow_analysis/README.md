# Airflow Analysis: Ventilation Dynamics and Air Quality Optimization

## Research Overview

This module investigates airflow patterns and indoor air quality in residential environments through systematic measurement and computational modeling of ventilation dynamics. The research addresses the fundamental question: *How do spatial configurations and ventilation strategies influence air quality, thermal distribution, and occupant comfort in domestic settings?*

## Theoretical Framework

### Fluid Dynamics Principles
- **Natural Ventilation**: Buoyancy-driven and wind-induced airflow
- **Pressure Differentials**: Stack effect and wind pressure influences
- **Air Exchange Rate**: Volume of air replacement per unit time
- **Mixing Efficiency**: Uniform distribution of fresh air throughout space

### Key Ventilation Parameters
- **Air Changes per Hour (ACH)**: Volumetric air exchange rate
- **Age of Air**: Time since air entered the space
- **Ventilation Effectiveness**: Distribution uniformity of fresh air
- **Pressure Coefficients**: External wind pressure effects on building

## Experimental Protocol

### Phase 1: Baseline Airflow Characterization
- **Objective**: Establish natural ventilation patterns in test environment
- **Duration**: 7 days of continuous airflow monitoring under various conditions
- **Parameters**: Air velocity, direction, temperature stratification, humidity gradients

### Phase 2: Opening Configuration Analysis
- **Objective**: Quantify ventilation effectiveness of different window/door arrangements
- **Method**: Systematic testing of opening combinations and sizes
- **Variables**: Opening area, position, orientation relative to prevailing winds

### Phase 3: Spatial Obstruction Impact
- **Objective**: Analyze airflow disruption caused by furniture and spatial organization
- **Method**: Controlled experiments with different room configurations
- **Metrics**: Flow visualization, velocity measurements, mixing efficiency

### Phase 4: Air Quality Correlation
- **Objective**: Establish relationship between airflow patterns and indoor air quality
- **Method**: Simultaneous measurement of ventilation and air quality parameters
- **Focus**: CO₂ levels, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds

## Data Collection Standards

### Measurement Protocol
- Air velocity: ±0.01 m/s accuracy, 3D vector measurements
- Air quality: CO₂, PM2.5, PM10, volatile organic compounds (VOCs)
- Environmental conditions: Temperature, relative humidity, barometric pressure
- External weather: Wind speed, direction, temperature

### Instrumentation Requirements
- Hot-wire anemometers for velocity measurements
- Multi-parameter air quality monitors
- Data logging systems with wireless connectivity

## Computational Models

### Air Exchange Rate Calculation
```
ACH = Q / V
Where: ACH = air changes per hour, Q = volumetric flow rate (m³/h), V = room volume (m³)
```

### Natural Ventilation Flow Rate
```
Q = Cd × A × √(2 × ΔP / ρ)
Where: Cd = discharge coefficient, A = opening area, ΔP = pressure difference, ρ = air density
```

### Mixing Efficiency Index
```
εₐ = (τₙ - τ̄) / (τₙ - τᵢ)
Where: τₙ = nominal time constant, τ̄ = average age of air, τᵢ = minimum possible age
```

### Comfort Ventilation Model
Integration of airflow patterns with thermal comfort parameters:
- Draft risk assessment
- Local thermal discomfort prediction
- Air quality-based ventilation requirements
- Energy efficiency optimization
