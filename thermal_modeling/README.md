# Thermal Modeling: Heat Transfer Analysis in Residential Spaces

## Research Overview

This module investigates thermal dynamics in domestic environments through systematic measurement and computational modeling of heat transfer mechanisms. The research addresses the fundamental question: *How can quantitative understanding of thermal behavior inform optimal spatial organization in residential architecture?*

## Theoretical Framework

### Heat Transfer Mechanisms
- **Conduction**: Heat flow through building materials (walls, windows, floors)
- **Convection**: Air movement and thermal circulation patterns
- **Radiation**: Solar heat gain and thermal emission from surfaces

### Key Parameters
- **U-values**: Thermal transmittance of building components
- **Thermal bridging**: Heat loss through structural connections
- **Thermal mass**: Heat storage capacity of materials
- **Orientation effects**: Solar exposure and seasonal variations

## Experimental Protocol

### Phase 1: Baseline Measurements
- **Objective**: Establish thermal baseline for test environment
- **Duration**: 7 days of continuous monitoring
- **Parameters**: Temperature distribution, humidity levels, surface temperatures

### Phase 2: Material Analysis
- **Objective**: Quantify thermal properties of common building materials
- **Method**: Comparative heat loss measurements across different surfaces
- **Variables**: Material type, thickness, surface finish

### Phase 3: Spatial Configuration Testing
- **Objective**: Analyze thermal impact of furniture placement and room organization
- **Method**: Controlled experiments with different spatial arrangements
- **Metrics**: Temperature gradients, energy efficiency, comfort indices

## Data Collection Standards

### Measurement Frequency
